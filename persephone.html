        <p>   There have been many greek mythological stories all with their own lessons and importance,while it is true none can be consider
            better than the other. <strong> <em> The Tragic Tale of presephone is a different game entirely</em></strong>, following the 
            evolution of a young naive godess to a vengeful coldhearted queen of the underworld.This ancient greek story is used to explain the 
            change of seasons,and th eternal cycle of death and rebirth,which am sure you will come to understand at the end of the story.</p>
        <br>
        <p>   Presephone(The godess of spring) The daughter of Demeter(Godess of agriculture) lived a carefree life on earth where she
             fulfilled her purpose of  giving love growth and fertility to humans, little did she know she had a stalker a deathly one. 
             On a faithful day while presephone was bathing <em>hades</em> god of the underworld emerged and kidnapped presephone taking her
             to the underworld. This left Demeter heart broken as she knew the reason why hades had taken her daughter was due to  deal 
             between zeus and hades as the gods stood witness to this deal that presephone would marry hades. Demeter neglected her duties
             leading to a great famine that threatened mankind, this lead to a consensus where presephone would be allowed an escape to earth to 
             visit her Mother Demetre in which will lead to a bountiful harvest.</p>
